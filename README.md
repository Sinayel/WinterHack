# WinterHack

# To-do :

### 1 ) option for a section for those who want to learn new languages and dialects
### 2 ) add a translator when a sentence is written with errors, a correction is proposed
### 3 ) 10 grammatical errors such as plural words written with an "s" or a singular sentence that should not be there, we can propose      exercises on this subject
### 4 ) make a level system example: at level 1 we start, at level 10 we have written more than 3000 characters having made only 10/15 mistakes (this is an example, so           that you understand what I mean) engros a level system that increases the more we write without making spelling mistakes
### 5 ) add a call function and notifications
### 6 ) add language exercises
### 7 ) add a validate icon when a message is read like on whatsapp
### 8 ) add a world clock and a birthday message
# Notes :
### 1 ) for the ia I think it would be better to put just a simple translator it's more if we have time to put an ia but not to get stuck on it is a detail
### 2 ) for the xp system also I think that it should not be too much abused on the number of fault to increase for not that it is not too simple, it would be necessary to find a right middle otherwise that will be too complicated to increase
